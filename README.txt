Program #2 README
<your name>, <your date>

1. Program status (what works, what doesn't)

    -  I believe that everythiing is working correctly
    -  For some reason I was not able to trim words correctly. My top words has 
       this -> ""



2. Do you have quality code? 
Note: See our coding guidelines, Javadoc, etc

    -  I know it looks all messy. I was tyring to refactor and java doc my code, 
       but I ran out of time



3. How to run your program

    -  I made three menus
        - First: The main menu asks the user to select the type of data sorting to use
        - Second: The Book menu allows to pick a book to sort in the data structure from
          previous selection
        - Third: The Results menu is commands avaliable to the user


4. Creative element

    - I know you liked the menu from p1 so I made three


5. Results (Top N words and counts, preformance)

    - For the most part it matches kinda close


6. Other notes

    - There are some methods in the data freq classes that doesnt use the methods
      I was not able to figure out how to use with abs freq so I kept it there so 
      it didnt scream at me
